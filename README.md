### Semantics

* Simplicity: pre-existing knowledge of users to minimise their learning curve when using a module, so anything with high unpredictability factor is a good candidate for re-design
* Least Effort: Everyone tends to follow the path that is as close to effortless as possible. 
* Opportunity Cost: To make a good economic decision, we want to choose the option with the greatest benefit to us but the lowest cost.
* Cost Of Delay: Emphasises holding on taking important actions and crucial decisions for as long as possible. 
* SOLID The SOLID principles do not only apply on software development but also when architecting a system.
