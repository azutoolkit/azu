### Schema

Schemas come to solve a simple problem. Sometimes we would like to have type-safe guarantee parameters when parsing HTTP requests or Hash(String, String) for a request. Schema shard resolve precisely this problem with the added benefit of enabling self validating schemas that can be applied to any object, requiring little to no boilerplate code making you more productive from the moment you use this shard.
