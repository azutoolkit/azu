* **Simplicity** Pre-existing knowledge of users to minimise their learning curve when using a module, so anything with high 
unpredictability factor is a good candidate for re-design
* **Least Effort** Everyone tends to follow the path that is as close to effortless as possible. 
* **Opportunity Cost** To make a good economic decision, we want to choose the option with the greatest benefit to us but the 
lowest cost.
* **Cost Of Delay** Emphasises holding on taking important actions and crucial decisions for as long as possible. 
* **SOLID** The SOLID principles do not only apply on software development but also when architecting a system.
